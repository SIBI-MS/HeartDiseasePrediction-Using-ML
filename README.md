### 1. HeartDiseasePrediction ‚ù§Ô∏è
In this project, I delve into the realm of healthcare by developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Utilizing a dataset containing various medical attributes such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age, I aim to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart disease.
